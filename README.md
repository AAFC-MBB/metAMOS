# MetAMOS Development UNSTABLE README

The master branch of metAMOS is always undergoing development and is unstable. Thus, we unfortunately will not be able to support users who are brave enough to use the master branch. Unless you are an expert and plan to diagnose/fix issues yourself, please do not use master. Intead, use the [latest tagged](https://github.com/marbl/metAMOS/releases/tag/v1.5rc3) release.
