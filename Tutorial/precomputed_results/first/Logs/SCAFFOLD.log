Invocation: /Users/treangen/dev/metAMOS/AMOS/Darwin-x86_64/bin/asmQC -b /Users/treangen/dev/metAMOS/Tutorial/first/Scaffold/in/proba.bnk -scaff -recompute -update -numsd 2 

Will update libraries in bank
Will not write features in bank
Mates within 2 standard deviations from mean considered good
Reporting regions with less than 0 good mate coverage
Will recompute library sizes
Libraries whose mean changes by less than 50
and whose std. dev. changes by less than 10 are considered to not have changed
Minimum number of observations required to change library size: 100
Reporting regions with more than 2 short mate coverage
Reporting regions with more than 2 long mate coverage
Reporting regions with more than 3 coverage by mates oriented the same way
Reporting regions with more than 3 coverage by outie mates
Reporting regions with more than 3 coverage by outie mates
Reporting regions with more than 3 coverage by linking mates
Reporting regions with more than 3 coverage by singleton mates


Reporting results by scaffold.  In this mode linking clones connect different scaffolds.
