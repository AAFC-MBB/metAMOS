**MetAMOS**: *a cohesive framework for isolate and metagenomic assembly and analysis*
=================================================================

=================
Overview
=================

MetAMOS is an open source, modular metagenomic (and isolate) genome assembly and analysis toolkit. MetAMOS represents a focused effort to create automated, reproducible, traceable assembly & analysis infused with the current best practices and state-of-the-art methods. MetAMOS for input can start with next-generation sequencing reads or assemblies, and as output, produces: assembly reports, genomic scaffolds, open-reading frames, variant motifs, taxonomic or functional annotations, Krona charts and HTML report.
